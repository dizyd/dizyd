## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a postdoctoral researcher at the Chair of Experimental Psychology at the University of Mannheim. I research the processes underlying people's judgments and how they can be described with mathematical models, ways to improves people's judgment and estimation accuracy, and how to measure and analyze similarity judgments.

I teach students about experimental design, R, and experimental psychology (e.g., cognitive illusion and biases). 

I also teach PhD courses about how to use R and the tidyverse (for beginners and advanced users) R Shiny, LaTeX and lab.js.
